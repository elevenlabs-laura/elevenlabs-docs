## Overview

For teams that want to collaborate in ElevenLabs, we offer shared workspaces. Workspaces offer the folowing benefits:

- **Shared billing** - Rather than having each of your team members individually create & manage subscriptions, all of your team’s character usage and billing is centralized under one workspace.
- **Shared resources** - Within a workspace, your team can share: voices, studio instances, conversational AI agents, dubbings and more.
- **Access management** - Your workspace admin can easily add and remove team members.
- **API Key management** - You can issue and revoke unlimited API keys for your team.

### Personal vs Workspace API Keys

When creating an API key on an Enterprise account, you can choose to create either a Personal API Key, or a Workspace API key.

#### Personal API Key

A personal API key allows an individual user to programmatically interact with the ElevenLabs API without using the web interface. This key is tied to a specific user, meaning it inherits the permissions and access rights of that user.

#### Workspace API Key

A workspace API key functions similarly but is not tied to a specific user. Instead, it allows a company or team to use the ElevenLabs API without relying on an individual employee's account.

#### Key Differences

1. **Longevity & Ownership**

   - A personal API key is linked to a specific user. If that user leaves the company or their account is deactivated, the API key is also disabled.
   - A workspace API key is independent of any single user, ensuring continuity for production systems.

2. **Use Case in Production Environments**

   - If a company relies on a personal API key for its production environment, there is a risk of disruptions if the associated user account is deactivated.
   - A workspace API key eliminates this risk, making it more reliable for business-critical applications.

A workspace API key functions much the same as an API key for a service account. This means it operates similarly to a user account but is explicitly designed for a shared production environment rather than for access by an individual user.

We recommend using a workspace API key for any long-term, production-critical API integrations to avoid issues related to user turnover or account deactivation.
